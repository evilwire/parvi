## Parvi? What is that?

I think it's the Finnish word for "flock" (as in a flock of birds), 
though I am not really sure. If it isn't clear already, I'm not Finnish.
I looked it up in Google Translate, and I am informed that it's pronounced
`/'pärvē/` or PAR-vee. 

If you are Finnish and you think I'm well silly, I'm sorry.
